The Haskell `safe-money` library offers type-safe and lossless encoding and
operations for monetary values in all world currencies, including fiat
currencies, precious metals and crypto-currencies.

You can enter a development shell with `nix-shell`, or build with `nix-build
./release.nix -A ghc822.safe-money` (or similar, check `release.nix`).
